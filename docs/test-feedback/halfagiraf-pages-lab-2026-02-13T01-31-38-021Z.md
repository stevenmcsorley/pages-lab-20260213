## Feedback
Iterate: Improve the Pages Lab site with: stronger typography system, more interesting background (grain/shape layers), better poster controls (palette presets + randomize + seed
  lock), better gallery (rename/delete/export), keyboard shortcuts (/? help), and a small “Share” panel that generates a shareable URL. Constraints: keep it static (no build step).
  Edit only: site/index.html, site/styles.css, site/app.js. Open a PR and reply with the PR link only.
